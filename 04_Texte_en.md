Intelligent reading

The *verbal-modal symbiosis*

## The Rule

*that dominates all rules*

*is that, except in pure melody,*

***singing is an intelligent reading,***

***well accented, well prosodized, well phrased.***

## Intelligent Reading

Intelligent < *intelligo, -ere* : to understand

**Linguam latinam cognoscamus !**

*Ut mens nostra concordet voci nostræ.*

> Vetus et nunquam intermissa linguæ Latinæ
> retineatur consuetudo, et, sicubi prope exoleverit,
> plane redintegretur.

The english word *sensible* could be a good translation
for "intelligent", as it includes not only
the intellectual part, but also the feelings associated with
the text, that the Church wants to communicate to us.

## The *Verbal-Modal Symbiosis*

------

### In theory

- There is a musical entity for each *independent* word,
  often a sort of melodic arc, and the words sing one by
  one before being linked.
- The final of the word receives a note that, for the ancient
  listener, was charged with the rhythmic weight of the
  final, closing the word.
- This final, like the accent, is independent of the ictus:
  we are not here at the lowest level of rhythmic analysis,
  but at the highest level of rhythm of each word.

------

The melodic position of the final respects, in one way
or another (there are very few exceptions), \
the *thetical necessity* of the final:

- simple melodic lowering;
- arrival on a modal string, *whether low or high*; this
  accounts for melodic “inversions”, where the final is
  melodically higher than the accent.

------

There is therefore an alliance of text and melody; \
the rhythm depends on the mode \
through the finale of the words:

the Gregorian composition is a \
*verbal-modal symbiosis*.

------

### In practice

. . .

The interpretation must follow the style of the composition :
the final syllable of each independent word must be softened,
in dependence of the accent.

. . .

The word must be sung in its
unity, ending in such a way that the listener grasps its unity, \
in its rhythm and in its meaning.

. . .

Then, as soon as this ending
is laid down as a verbal rest after the accent (but not before),
the voice should be given some warmth or restraint, thus
preparing the “crossfade” with what follows, depending on
the musical context.

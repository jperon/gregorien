Relationship between text and musical rhythm

The *ictus*

## The Rule

***singing is an intelligent reading,***

***well accented, well prosodized, well phrased.***

## Definition Of Rhythm

. . .

Rhythm is the *intellectual* ordinance of sound movement,

. . .

***which one*** is constituted by the variations \
of the physical qualities of sound:

- pitch
- intensity
- duration.

. . .

In a broader sense, *rhythm* can mean \
the sound movement itself.

------

The rhythm results from the
relations established by the spirit between the sounds perceived
by the ear, and is the *synthesis*.

. . .

By analogy with local movement, we will say that rhythm
is the synthesis of an *impulse* and a *rest*.

------

This synthesis is realized around a pole : \
the *accent*, or summit.

. . .

What precedes is the impulse phase (or *arsis*); \
what follows it is the rest phase (or *thesis*).

------

As many different levels of analysis can be identified
as there are different types of summits.
The real variations of the sound qualities will be more tenuous
the lower the level of analysis.

## Relationship Between Text And Musical Rhythm

. . .

At the highest levels of rhythmic synthesis (incise and phrase),
the rhythm is totally dependent on the text.

. . .

This is not the case if we go further down in the analysis.
The primary elements of the text and the melody do not
always coincide ; this depends on the style of composition.

------

### Semi-adorned Style

Frequent coincidence of melodic and verbal primary elements.

. . .

To look intelligent, say *semi-melismatic*.

------

### Adorned Style

Several melodic entities on a single word.

To look intelligent, say *melismatic*.

------

### Syllabic Style

Several words into a single melodic entity.

. . .

Unfortunately, there’s no way to look intelligent here.

## The *Ictus*

. . .

Going down to the lowest level of rhythmic analysis, one is led to an
*elementary rhythm*, which is the *relationship established by the mind between
two sounds*, one in *impulse*, the other in *rest*, and merges them both into
*one movement*.

. . .

One thus finds such a rest, named *ictus*, \
every two or three beats.

------

By itself, this ictus is :

- neither a strong beat compared to a weak beat;
- nor a long beat compared to a short beat;
- nor a low sound compared to a high sound.

. . .

Generally *determined* by a variation in one of these orders,
it can sometimes be no objective at all, and be a pure creation of the mind,
as a consequence of its natural need to analyze.

------

### Rules For Ictus Placement

1. Vertical episema
2. Sustained notes
3. Notes beginning a group
4. Common sense: finals of words, accents…
5. In last resort, *binary regression*.
